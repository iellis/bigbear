description: "The math behind golf ball simulation is really tricky. I had done some work on simulating golf balls for game prototypes in the past, so it was great fun to help upgrade SkyTrak's simulation. I took their legacy code and added new capabilities that enabled them to launch their app-driven simulator system."
